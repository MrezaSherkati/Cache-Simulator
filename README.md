# Cache-Simulator

## Introduction

In this project I designed a cache simulator which simulates the direct mapped to fully associative cache. This cache is unified, which means that data and istruction are in the same cache. This sumulator also uses the writing policy of write back and write allocate. 

## How to run the code

For running this code, use the command "make -f Makefile" in Linux operating system. This command will compile and connect "cache.c" and "main.c" C code files and creates an executable "sim" file.
